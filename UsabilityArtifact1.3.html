	<h3>Usability Artifact 1.3:<br>Zillow Usability Report
	      </h3>
	<p><strong>Course: Usability of Systems & Services</strong></p>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This is a three-person group report analyzing the usability of the Zillow app. I helped to organize the usability test, narrow down the target audience, create tasks, recruit participants, complete Zoom testing, write the report, and create screenshots.</p>
	
	<h4>How it Represents Usability Competency 1.3 (Usability Data Collection & Analysis)</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>For this report we analyzed the data from the System Usability Scale (SUS), Single Ease of Use Questions (SEQ), and the Task completion rates to make recommendations on the improvement of the Zillow app.</p>
	<h4>Reflection</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This was my first usability test and I learned quite a few valuable lessons. First, creating tasks can be difficult. They must be created in a way that is specific, yet doesnâ€™t give clues to the participant as to how to complete the task. We also need to test the tasks ourselves. For example, the task I created was to find a house under $300,000 in the 23111 zip code and Hanover High district.  This is where I live and I know there are always houses for sale. However, the 23111 zip code is only a small part of the Hanover high district. As a result, the participants had a difficult time finding a house in that zip code and school district. Most participants failed to complete the task. This was not a failure of the system and a rewritten task would have helped us to better evaluate the system. Pilot testing would have helped us to realize that we need to rewrite the task which would have made the testing more accurate. The second thing I learned is that finding participants is difficult. This is something to keep in mind if I am ever required to perform a usability test at work.  The last thing I learned is that it takes practice to analyze results. We have all the numbers, but what do they mean?  For each task, you can compare the scores, but it seems like it would take skill and experience to read beyond the scores and look at the participant feedback to find themes. </p>
