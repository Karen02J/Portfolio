  <h3>Artifact 2.2:<br> Evaluation of an Online Course
	</h3>
	<p><strong>Course: Formative & Summative Evaluation</strong></p>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This document contains a formative and summative evaluation plan for an Art History course at St. Louis community college. I completed this report as part of a two-person team. </p>
	
	<h4>How it Represents Competency 2.2</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
<p>Our group gathered data, created a formative and summative plan, and then performed a formative evaluation on the accessibility of the course.</p>
	<h4>Reflection</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>I originally took this course because I thought it contained information about evaluating students.  Instead it was about evaluating learning programs which I came to understand is equally important. I was unable to come up with a work-related project of my own so my classmate was able to find a professor who had a course to evaluate. Due to privacy issues we were unable to get into the course to see its elements in the Blackboard learning management system, but we were able to get screen captures and course documents to help guide us.  Having access to students would also have greatly helped our evaluation. Even with these limitations, we had enough information to properly evaluate the course and make recommendations.</p>
