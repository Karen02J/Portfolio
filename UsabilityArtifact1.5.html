  <h3>Usability Artifact 1.5:<br> Technology, Social Justice, and Inclusion
	</h3>
	<p><strong>Course: Interaction Design and Usability of Systems and Services</strong></p>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>The following page includes examples of social justice and inclusion. The first example is an individual response to a discussion question on technology and social justice. The second example contains screen captures and text from a group project that explain how we aimed to make our app accessible to all. </p>
	
	<h4>How They Represent Usability Competency 1.5 (Diversity & Inclusion Methods to Increase Efficient & Effective Use)</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
<p>The answer to the discussion question will help to guide me as I create technology projects.  The group project shows deliberate consideration for those who have disabilities.</p>
	<h4>Reflection</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>I have never considered the relationship between technology and social justice until I was asked to consider the topic for a discussion board question. I have always been conscious of accessibility in the online course materials I create so I will continue to do that and educate others about the importance of accessibility. Going forward, I will be mindful to create learning environments that are inclusive to all and continue to seek ways to learn more about how to do that.</p>
	<h4>Artifact Information</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This page contains:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Philosophy on Technology and Social Justice</li>
		<li>Inclusivity and Cultural Analysis examples from the Trash Warrior app</li>
		<li>Video of accessibility featrues in the Trash Warrior App</li>
	</ul><br><br>
	<h4>Technology and Social Justice</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This philosophy is a respons to a discussion question from the Usability of Systems and Services course.</p>
	<div id="inclusion">
	<h4>My Philosophy on Technology & Social Justice</h4>
	<p class="inclusion1"><span>I</span>n some cases, technology creates a greater divide between the haves and the have-nots. For example, during COVID-19 and distance learning, students who lack access to technology may fall further behind their peers in school. Technology also has the potential to help make school and work more equitable for those with disabilities, recent  immigrants, and students in poor or remote locations. An easy-to use text to speech app could help someone who is blind to navigate a web page. The same could be true for a translation app that could be used by a recent immigrant.</p>
	<p class="inclusion2">Usability can also benefit students in remote or underfunded schools.  Technology could give them access to AP courses not normally offered in their school. A college-finder app could help them to learn about schools and financial aid information that would be previously unknown to them.  These tools could help make students more competitive with their peers for college admissions and future job prospects.</p>
	<p class="inclusion2">In order to level the playing field for all, the technology must be easily available to all types of users.  Once the technology is available, it must be usable enough to help the users easily navigate the world around them.</p>

	<p>Although my projects are complete, here is how I would consider diversity and inclusion in the future.</p>
