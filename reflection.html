	<h4>What I've Learned</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>Way back in 2016 I was browsing online programs to find an online course of study that might interest me. I hit the jackpot when I found the University of Missouri’s learning technologies and design EdS program. At the time I had no idea that an EdS degree existed, but this program allowed me to advance beyond a master’s degree and learn about things that I enjoy&mdash;design and instructional theories.  I found the courses to be very hands-on whereas the courses in my master’s program were mostly theoretical.</p>
	<p>Thanks to several moves, it took me five years to complete my degree. Each class was immediately applicable to my new position as an assistant instructional technology specialist.  Some classes were more challenging than others. For example, I was a little out of my comfort zone in the <em>Designing Games for Learning</em> course as I don’t really play many games. But I eventually learned to think about game design and how it can be used in learning. I put off the <em>Introduction to Research in ISLT</em> course until my final semester because I thought it would be tedious and boring and because I don’t consider myself to be a research type of person. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I’m about halfway through this course and while it’s time-consuming, I am enjoying it very much. Thanks to this class, I am now able to understand the research reports that I read.</p>
	<p>This program has also inspired me to explore other areas in learning technologies and design. While in the program, I also completed the online educator certificate and the usability and user experience certificate. My favorite course in the whole program was <em>Teaching Online Courses</em>. This class was very hands-on and I was amazed that I could take a course that I taught face-to-face and make it engaging in an online environment.  The usability and user experience courses gave me a framework to evaluate any education products I create in the future. </p>

	
	
	<h4>The Future</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This program helped me to find my strengths, develop any weaknesses, and find my focus for future career plans. I consider myself a lifelong learner so while my formal education stops here, I plan to continue to learn new technology skills to help me in my career.</p></div>
