  <h3>Usability Artifact 1.1:<br> Oboe 101
	</h3>
	<p><strong>Course: Front End Analysis of Systems</strong></p>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This individual project was created for band directors who teach beginning oboe students. These band directors are likely non-oboe players.</p>
	
	<h4>How it Represents Usability Competency 1.1 (Needs Assessment & Task Analysis)</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
<p>This project is based on the ASK system which helps users to perform job tasks through the interface of a system. This system is designed as though the users are having a conversation with an expert and the types of questions used are job task questions and goal-oriented procedural knowledge questions.                                                   </p>
	<h4>Reflection</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This was my first experience with creating interactive PowerPoint slides. For this portfolio, I converted the PowerPoint into a PDF and embedded it into the website. For the first time, I had to think about usability and how the audience could navigate a system. Getting all the landing pages and links to work was quite challenging and, in the end, my project worked as intended. This artifact provides all of the information of a Q and A document with a list of resources, but is more interactive which should help a band director perform the job tasks of teaching beginning oboe students.</p>
