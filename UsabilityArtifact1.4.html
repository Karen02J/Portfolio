	 <h3>Usability Artifact 1.4:<br> Trash Warrior Trash App
	</h3>
	<p><strong>Course: Interaction Design</strong></p>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>This is a report contains all of the documentation for the prototype for a trash removal app.  I was in a team of three people and wrote 1/3 of the report, designed the logo, contributed two mock ups, coordinated and facilitated Zoom meetings, and managed the document presentation and turn-in of the report.</p>
	
	<h4>How it Represents Usability Competency 1.4 (Usability Engineering & Iterative Design through Prototyping)</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
<p>The report contains descripts of the high fidelity and the low fidelity of prototypes with screen captures representing them.  The link to the prototype is no longer available.  This PDF documents the process from determining the audience, to testing, to the high fidelity prototype.</p>
	<h4>Reflection</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>I never realized that there is so much work involved in designing an app. First, there has to be a purpose for an app.  Then, it has to be designed in such a way that it meets the approval of the stakeholders and the needs of the end-user.  Also, one cannot create an app and be done with it. There are continuous improvements that have to be made based on the feedback of the users. For example, maps are constantly being updated so we have to keep our app up-to-date to reflect current maps and trash sites.</p>
	<p>Our peer evaluations let us know quickly if the app helps them to reach their goal. The app is not useful if users cannot easily sign up, find the trash site, mark the site, and perform a clean-up.  Our classmate evaluations let us know where the problems lie and where they had difficulty completing a task.</p>
	<p>The documentation of this process seemed tedious and unnecessary at times, but in the end, the information proved to be valuable and would really be useful in the launch of an app. As I complete the portfolio, I am looking through the classmate suggestions and the changelog and I realize the app looks different from the intitial plan to the deployment. The historical data would be helpful in making major updates or creating a similar app.</p> 
	<p>I wonder what the lifecycle of an app like this would be.  What is the moment where this app would no longer be useful?  I imagine that periodic evaluations would be needed to keep the app current.  So, the app is never a finished product and should consistently be evaluated and tested as part of the iterative design process.</p>
