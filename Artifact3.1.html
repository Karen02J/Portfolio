  <h3>Artifact 3.1:<br> Synchronous Course Using Zoom: <br>Creating Accessible Word Documents
	</h3>
	<p><strong>Course: Teaching Online Courses</strong></p>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">

<p>These documents are from Teaching Online Courses and represent a synchronous lesson on making Word documents accessible for those with disabilities. This page contains a lesson plan and the embedded Wakelet contains all of the course content. This was an independent project, but classmates participated as students and gave feedback when the lesson was over.</p>
	<h4>How it Represents Competency 3.1</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2012) 5.6 million people (19% of the population) had a disability in 2010. Our classes, both face-to-face and online, could contain students with a number of disabilities.  By law, these students need to have access to accessible course materials.  The material supplementing this lesson focuses on making Word documents accessible. </p>
	<h4>Reflection</h4>
	<hr class="reflect">
	<p>Since accessibility is a passion of mine and I have taught similar lessons face-to-face, I was a little nervous that the hands-on portions of the lesson would be next to impossible in the online environment. My participants were both proficient with Zoom so I was able to focus on my lesson and not on technology issues. The lesson went well and we were able to stay on task.  My goal was to demonstrate making the document accessible, have the students walk me through making the document accessible, and then have them make a sample document accessible on their own.  The Wakelet contains all the examples so they were able to download these documents prior to the lesson which saved time. We didn’t have enough time to do the individual project so the participants walked me through a third example.</p>
<p>This lesson may not work for those who are less technology savvy so I may need to find a way to accommodate a wide range of abilities if I use this lesson in the future. The pre-course survey let me know what proficiency levels the participants had so I knew where to start. I could make a pre-course tutorial of basic skills students would need to start this lesson. I did find that I was able to share the participants’ screen and trouble shoot if there was a problem. I selected Word because I believe that most people have access to that program and have some degree of proficiency with it. Overall, this lesson went really well and I was able to answer additional questions that my classmates had about accessibility. </p>
